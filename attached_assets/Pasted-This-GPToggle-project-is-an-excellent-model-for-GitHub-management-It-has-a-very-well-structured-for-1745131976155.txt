This GPToggle project is an excellent model for GitHub management. It has a very well-structured format with several key organizational elements that make it maintainable and expandable:

Key Project Structure Elements
Modular Architecture

Core functionality is separated into distinct modules (providers, utilities, configuration)
Each AI provider is implemented as a separate module that follows a common interface
New providers can be added without changing existing code
Multiple Distribution Options

Both standalone files (gptoggle_minimal.py, gptoggle_enhanced.py) for quick use
Full package structure for proper installation via pip
JavaScript versions for web integration
Comprehensive Documentation

Detailed README with clear feature descriptions
Separate documentation files for specific topics (INSTALLATION.md, API_DOCS.md)
Well-maintained CHANGELOG that follows semantic versioning
Inline code documentation with docstrings
Example Files

Provider-specific examples (llama_example.py, perplexity_example.py)
Use case examples that demonstrate key features
Minimal examples for quick start
Testing and Quality Assurance

Test files for verifying functionality
Installation verification scripts
Project Management Approach
The project follows several best practices that you could adopt:

Semantic Versioning

Clear version numbering (1.0.4) with proper increments
Detailed changelogs for each version
Feature Branches

Each major feature (like adding Llama and Perplexity providers) is a discrete addition
Improvements are organized into focused updates
Backward Compatibility

New versions maintain compatibility with previous versions
Legacy support through compatibility functions
Environment Flexibility

Works across different environments (standard Python, Replit, web)
Adapts to available dependencies
If you're building a similar project for GitHub, I would recommend adopting this structure with:

A clear core interface that stays stable
Modular components that can evolve independently
Comprehensive documentation that's updated with each change
Example files that demonstrate real-world usage
A well-maintained changelog to track the project's evolution
